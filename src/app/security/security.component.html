        <h3 class="uk-heading-line"><span>Authentication</span></h3>
        <h4><span>Auth0 Overview</span></h4>
        <p>Auth0 is a service that abstracts how users authenticate to applications.</p>
        <img src="assets/images/auth0.png">

        <h4><span>Encryption, Password Hashing</span></h4>
        <p>Auth0 helps prevent critical identity data from falling into the wrong hands. Auth0 never store passwords as
          clear text - they are always hashed (and salted) securely using bcrypt. Both data at rest and in motion is
          encrypted - all network communication uses TLS with at least 128-bit AES encryption. The connection uses TLS
          v1.2, and it is encrypted and authenticated using AES_128_GCM and uses ECDHE_RSA as the key exchange
          mechanism. Qualsys' SSL Labs <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=manage.auth0.com&latest">
            scored Auth0's SSL implementation as "A+"</a> on their SSL Server test.</p>

        <h4><span>Password Complexity</span></h4>
        <p>With Auth0 you can enforce five levels of password complexity, as well as custom rules implementing <a
          href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet#Implement_Proper_Password_Strength_Controls">OWASP
          recommendations</a> and more.</p>

        <h4><span>Attack Prevention, Mitigation</span></h4>
        <p>Auth0 services are architected with high-availability and resilience in mind. Auth0 applications have
          built-in rate limiting and automated blocking features to mitigate advanced denial of service or
          authentication attacks. Our network infrastructure is protected against volumetric attacks by our cloud
          providers, in addition to a dedicated DDoS mitigation service.</p>

        <h4><span>Secure Infrastructure</span></h4>
        <p>Auth0 takes advantage of the industry's most sophisticated, battle-tested infrastructure. We run on hardened
          Linux hosts with automatic security patching, carefully-configured security groups, segmented VPCs, and
          role-based access controls, combined with many other advanced protections built into the cloud
          infrastructure.</p>

        <h3 class="uk-heading-line"><span>Session Management</span></h3>
        <h4><span>Create session</span></h4>
        <p>Once the user is logged in, a client-side session is created for them. To do this, the user's
          <code>id_token</code> that is returned in the Lock <code>authenticated</code> callback parameter
          is stored in <code>localStorage</code>.
        </p>

        <h4><span>Check the session</span></h4>
        <p>Determining whether the user is authenticated on the client side is simply a matter of checking whether they
          have a JWT in local storage. Since JWT authentication is stateless (no session exists on the server), the
          presence of a JWT is all that is needed to give the front-end application some indication that the user is
          authenticated.</p>

        <h4><span>Logout</span></h4>
        <p>To log a user out, a method that removes their token from localStorage is implemented.</p>

        <h3 class="uk-heading-line"><span>Tokens used by strongCommerce</span></h3>
        <h4><span>ID Tokens</span></h4>
        <p>The ID token, usually referred to in Auth0's docs as <code>id_token</code>, is a
          <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/jwt">JSON Web Token (JWT)</a> that contains user
          profile information (like the user's name, email, and so forth), represented in the form of claims. These
          claims are statements about the user, which can be trusted if the consumer of the token can verify its
          signature.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3 class="uk-heading-line"><span>Account Takeover Prevention Via ThisData</span></h3>
        <p>This rule is designed to detect phished or compromised user accounts and block attackers from logging in to
          hacked accounts. Even if the primary user authentication is approved (e.g. correct username and password) it
          will deny access if the login appears to be highly suspicious.</p>
        <p>It uses ThisData's anomaly detection algorithms which take into account many behavioural factors
          including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Location & Velocity</li>
          <li>Devices</li>
          <li>Time of day</li>
          <li>Tor usage</li>
          <li>Risky IP addresses</li>
          <li>and more...</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This rule uses ThisData's API to get a risk score for the login, and then blocks the login by raising an
          *UnauthorizedError* error if the risk is very high.</p>

        <h3 class="uk-heading-line"><span>Account Takeover Detection Via ThisData</span></h3>
        <p>This rule is designed to detect phished or compromised user accounts, and optionally send an email or SMS
          notification to the user asking "Was This You?". This is similar to the emails we get signing in to Google or
          Facebook from a new device or location. The users' response can be used to take further action, like shutting
          down a compromised account.</p>
        <p>This rule works in the background, and will never stop the users from logging in to the application.</p>

        <h3 class="uk-heading-line"><span>Multi-factor authentication With Google Authenticator</span></h3>
        <p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a method of computer access control in which a user is granted access
          only after successfully presenting several separate pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism â€“
          typically at least two of the following categories: knowledge (something they know), possession (something
          they have), and inherence (something they are).</p>
        <p>This rule is used to trigger multifactor authentication with Google Authenticator when a condition is
          met.</p>
        <p>Upon first login, the user can enroll the device by scanning a QR code. Subsequent logins will ask for the
          Google Authenticator code.</p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <h3 class="uk-heading-line" id="password-policy"><span>Password Policy</span></h3>
        <p>Password strength is an important consideration when using passwords for authentication. A strong password
          policy will make it difficult, if not improbable, for someone to guess a password through either manual or
          automated means.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>At least 10 characters in length</li>
          <li>Contain at least 3 of the following 4 types of characters:
            <ul>
              <li>Lower case letters (a-z)</li>
              <li>Upper case letters (A-Z)</li>
              <li>Numbers (i.e. 0-9)</li>
              <li>Special characters (e.g. !@#$%^&* )</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>At most 128 characters</li>
          <li>Not more than 2 identical characters in a row (e.g., 111 not allowed)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="uk-heading-line" id="password-history"><span>Password History</span></h4>
        <p>The system will maintain a password history for each user and prevent the reuse of passwords included in the
          history.</p>

        <h4 class="uk-heading-line" id="password-dictionary"><span>Password Dictionary</span></h4>
        <p>Do not allow passwords that are part of the password dictionary. The default dictionary is a list of the
          10,000
          most common passwords (click <a
            href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/10k_most_common.txt"></a> to see the
          list).</p>

        <h4 class="uk-heading-line" id="personal-data"><span>Personal Data</span></h4>
        <p>Do not allow passwords that contain any part of the user's personal data. This includes the user's `name`,
          `username`, `nickname`, `user_metadata.name`, `user_metadata.first`, `user_metadata.last`. The user's `email`
          or the first part of it, `firstpart@email.com` will also be checked.</p>
